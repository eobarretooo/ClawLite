# Summarize

Use this skill when content is long and the user wants distilled output.

## Output shape

Return:
1. Key points
2. Risks/decisions
3. Actionable next steps

## Rules

- Preserve hard facts (numbers, deadlines, owners).
- Avoid generic filler.
- If content is too large, deliver an executive summary first and ask which section to expand.

## Good inputs

- CI logs
- design docs
- long chat transcripts
- meeting notes
